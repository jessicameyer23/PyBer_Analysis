# Overview of the Analysis
My assignment included a ride-sharing summary dataframe by city type and a line chart of total fares for each city type.  I am tasked with summarizes how the data is different by city type as well as provide business recommendations that could be made to improve operations.

# Results
My first dataframe summary which is pictured below shows some of the differences by city type below.  I will describe some of the key items noted in differences:

1. **Total Rides and Total Drivers: **

The total rides is much less for rural, with a total ride count of 125 compared to suburban rides of 625 and urban rides of 1,625.  Drivers significantly increase from rural to urban as well, increasing from 78 rural drivers, to 490 suburban drivers to 2,405 urban drivers.  One interesting note takeaway is that calculating average rides per driver, shows that in the urban area, there are more drivers than total rides so on average the ride per driver is less than one.  However, on the rural side, the rides are much more than the number of drivers, so the average number of rides per driver is greater than one.

2.  **Total Fares, Average Ride per Fare and Average Fare per Driver:**

Total fares were $4,327 for rural, $19,356 for suburban and $39,854 for urban.  The average fare per ride was higher for rural and then decreased for suburban and was the lowest for urban with an average fare per ride of $24.53.  The average fare per driver was much higher for rural drivers, with a total average fare per driver of $55.49.  The average fare per driver for suburban was $39.50 and the average fare per driver for urban was $16.57.
