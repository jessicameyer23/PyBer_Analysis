# Overview of the Analysis
My assignment included a ride-sharing summary dataframe by city type and a line chart of total fares for each city type.  I am tasked with summarizes how the data is different by city type as well as provide business recommendations that could be made to improve operations.

# Results
My first dataframe summary which is pictured below shows some of the differences by city type below.  I will describe some of the key items noted in differences:

1. Total Rides and Total Drivers: 

The total rides is much less for rural, with a total ride count of 125 compared to suburban rides of 625 and urban rides of 1,625.  Drivers significantly increase from rural to urban as well, increasing from 78 rural drivers, to 490 suburban drivers to 2,405 urban drivers.  One interesting takeaway is that when you calculate the average rides per driver, this shows that in the urban area, there are more drivers than total rides so on average the ride per driver is less than one.  However, on the rural side, the rides are much more than the number of drivers, so the average number of rides per driver is greater than one.

2.  **Total Fares, Average Ride per Fare and Average Fare per Driver:**

Total fares were $4,327 for rural, $19,356 for suburban and $39,854 for urban.  The average fare per ride was higher for rural and then decreased for suburban and was the lowest for urban with an average fare per ride of $24.53.  The average fare per driver was much higher for rural drivers, with a total average fare per driver of $55.49.  The average fare per driver for suburban was $39.50 and the average fare per driver for urban was $16.57.

# Summary: Business Recommendations
To address some of the disparties by city type, I have the following recommendations:
1.  It appears that the urban area has more drivers than are needed, as they are averaging less than one ride per driver.  I would recommend allocating drivers from urban to the rural and suburban areas to better balance the drivers.  
2.  Wage disparities:  Currently, there are wage disparties among the groups, as the average fare per rural driver is much higher than the average fare per urban driver.  As I mentioned above, reallocating drivers from urban to  rural and suburban areas would help address this issue, however another recommendation that I have is to consider ways to increase demand and perform some additional analysis on the needs of consumers for each of the areas.  Is there a greater need for drivers during certain times of the month, or certain events that are planned in the cities?  I would recommend analyzing trends to better allocate drivers real time to meet the needs of consumers while also maximizing driver fare.
3.  Another recommendation is to perform a time analysis.  Perhaps some of our drivers are competing at the same time of the day for the same consumers, but during other parts of the day we may not have coverage when demand is needed by consumers.  This could identify ways to shift the times of day that drivers are working to better meet the needs of consumers and not have drivers competing for a limited source of riders.
